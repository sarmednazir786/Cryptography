## Details:
* difficulty: Easy
* category: Cryptography 
* author: Sarmed
* flags: flag{cracked} 

## Description:
This is a cryptic message that will need to be deciphered to unveil the message.

## Hint:
Encoding strengthens Encryption.

## Intended Learning and outcome:

With the given challenge, I explored different kinds of encryption algorithms along with encoding procedures. 

## Solution: 

This text looks base64 encoded, we can search it on internet and see that our assumption is correct. When we decode it, we retrieve a value and ROT13 is mentioned in it, we decipher it using the ROT13 algorithm, this can be done easily through the internet. The deciphered message has the flag.
